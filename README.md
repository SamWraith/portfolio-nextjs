# Hello, 
## I am Samir Nandan Pandey

This repo consists of my portfolio website which I have made using the cutting edge technology from Vercel - **Next.js** 

I have beautifully designed this website which makes it look stunning and beautiful.

Below are the steps to run the repo in your local env after cloning the repo. 😁

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.



## Thank You 😁
